# Football-xG-model-Similar-Players

a)  xG tells us about the probability of a shot being scored. I’ve taken several features including angle, whether the shot was taken from the preferred foot, distance into account while building the model. Finally, I’ve used different classifiers in order to demonstrate the best model.


b)  The 2nd part of this project is identifying players that are similar to each other using. Used dimensionality reduction after dropping meaningless dimensions and then fitting after using PCA and K Means clustering to identify similar types of players.
